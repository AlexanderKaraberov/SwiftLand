#Combinators

Combinatory logic is a rephrasing of the lambda calculus that avoids explicit mention of variables and of lambda abstraction. 
Instead it uses combinators. In the most common case, they are traditionally called S, K and I but there are actually more of them.
Basically combinator is a  generalized function whose argument is also a function and there are no free variables.
Combinators can be used in the study of algebra, topology, and category theory, and have found application in the study of programs in algorithmic languages.
