# SwiftLand Âµframework

This small library will selectively include some code from beautiful https://github.com/typelift frameworks with additions and improvements. It will contain only general-purpose FP-oriented stuff without heavy functional abstract idioms and category theory concepts. Also this library tries to reimplement functions similar to ones found in Haskell Data/Prelude libraries in idiomatic Swift way. In addition there will be some general helpers for everyday tasks. Each function has detailed comments, which you can use as docs.
