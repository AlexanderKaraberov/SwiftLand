# SwiftLand Âµframework

This library will selectively icnlude code from beautiful https://github.com/typelift frameworks such as: Swiftz and Basis, but with some additions and will contain only general-purpose and FP-oriented stuff without heavy functional abstract idioms and category theory concepts. Also this library will include another functions similar to Haskell beautiful Base library reimplemented in Swift. I want to create an aggregate library which reuse code from existing libraries plus my own to simplify general iOS development in Swift.
