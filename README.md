# SwiftLand Âµframework

This library will selectively icnlude code from such beautiful frameworks from https://github.com/typelift as Swiftz, Swiftx, Basis, Concurrency and others, but with some additions and will contain only general-purpose and FP-oriented stuff without heavy absctract idioms and category theory concepts. I want to create an aggregate library which reuse code from existing libraries plus my own to simplify general iOS development in Swift.
<p> In future I'm planning to add more useful stuff here.
