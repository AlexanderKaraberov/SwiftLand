# SwiftLand Âµframework

This library will selectively include code from beautiful https://github.com/typelift frameworks such as: Swiftz and Basis, but with some additions and improvements and will contain only general-purpose FP-oriented stuff without heavy functional abstract idioms and category theory concepts. Also this library will include another functions similar to ones found in Haskell Data/Prelude libraries reimplemented in Swift. I want to create an aggregate library which reuse code from existing libraries plus my own to simplify general iOS development in Swift. Each function has detailed comments, which you can use as docs.
