# SwiftLand Âµframework 2.0.1

We can define functional programming as *programming only with computable Scott-continuous functions which map set of inputs (domain) to the set of permissible outputs (codomain) with the property that each input is related to exactly one output*.
 
These functions can possibly be nonterminated but this is not true in languages with totality checking such as Idris. So in my opinion totality is not a mandatory requirement for functional programming. In simple words functional programming is about side effects, how to deal with them, how to make them explicit and how to reason about the whole program mathematically (as though we are solving an algebraic expression).

<p>SwiftLand is a small library which contains useful higher-order functions which can be used to simplify Swift development and to make functional programming a little bit simpler in Swift. There is nothing super new here. Similar functions can be found in Haskell, Idris, PureScript standard libraries. Each function has detailed comments, which can be used as documentation.</p>

SwiftLand contains:
* Catamorphism: `foldRight` (fold from the right). Swift currently has only [reduce](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Reference/Swift_SequenceType_Protocol/index.html#//apple_ref/swift/intfm/SequenceType/s:FeRq_Ss12SequenceType_SsS_6reduceu__Rq_S__Fq_FzTqd__7combineFzTqd__qqq_S_9GeneratorSs13GeneratorType7Element_qd___qd__) function, which is equivalent to the `foldLeft` in classic FP literature.
* Special cases of `foldLeft` and `foldRight`: `foldLeft1` and `foldRight1` which use array's first element as initial element and don't work for empty lists.
* Hylomorphism (`hylo`) and paramorphism (`para`) which are decribed in classical paper about recursion schemes: [Functional Programming with Bananas  Lenses  Envelopes and Barbed Wire](http://eprints.eemcs.utwente.nl/7281/01/db-utwente-40501F46.pdf)
* Special folds: `sum`, `product`.
* `mapWithIndex`, `until`
* `curry`, and its inverse `uncurry` for different number of arguments.
*  General purpose list processing functions: `filterLength`, `intercalate`, `null`, `concat`, `intersperse`, `span`, `concatMap`, `groupBy`, `splitAt`, `find`, `remove`, `uniq`, `scanl`, `iterateWhile`, `decompose`.
* Cons lists with list pattern matching
* Zipping/unzipping lists: `zip3`, `zipWith`, `unzip`. (Swift standard library already has a usual [zip](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Reference/Swift_StandardLibrary_Functions/index.html#//apple_ref/swift/func/s:FSs3zipu0_Rq_Ss12SequenceTypeq0_S__FTq_q0__GVSs12Zip2Sequenceq_q0__) function)
* [Combinators](https://wiki.haskell.org/Combinator). Besides well-known combinators from [SKI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SKI_combinator_calculus)/[BCKW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B,_C,_K,_W_system), I also will add one by one combinators from the great book [To Mock a Mockingbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Mock_a_Mockingbird). Currently implemented in Combinators.swift: C-combinator (`flip`), K-combinator (`const`), Y-combinator: (`fix`), I-combinator (`id`), Psi-combinator (`on`), S-combinator (`substitute`), B-combinator (compose), A-combinator (apply), W-combinator (duplicate).
