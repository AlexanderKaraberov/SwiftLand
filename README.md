# SwiftLand Âµframework

This small library contains useful FP-oriented functions to simplify general Swift development. It will contain only general-purpose FP-oriented stuff without heavy functional abstract idioms and category theory concepts. The main idea of SwiftLand is to support idea of [functional in the small, OOP in the large](http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2009/03/23/functional-in-the-small-oo-in-the-large/), and not to pretend that Swift is a purely functional language, because it is [not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency), so there are no monads, monad transformers, arrows and comonads in it, but only small pieces of functional ideas. Also you should read [this paper](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2611829). This library will selectively include some code from beautiful https://github.com/typelift frameworks with additions and without heavy constructs. Also SwiftLand tries to reimplement functions similar to ones found in Haskell Data/Prelude libraries in idiomatic Swift way. In addition there will be some general helpers for everyday tasks. Each function has detailed comments, which you can use as docs. Library is in development and not ready for production now, but you can selectively use some functions from it.
