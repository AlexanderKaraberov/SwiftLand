# SwiftLand Âµframework

This library will icnlude code from such beautiful frameworks as https://github.com/typelift/Swiftz but with some additions and will contain only general-purpose stuff without heavy fucntional programming and category theory concepts.
<p> In future I'm planning to add more useful stuff here.
