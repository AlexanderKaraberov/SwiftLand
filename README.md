# SwiftLand Âµframework

This small library contains useful FP-oriented functions to simplify general Swift development. It will contain only general-purpose FP-oriented stuff without heavy functional abstract idioms and category theory concepts. The main idea of SwiftLand is to support idea of [functional in small, OOP in the large](http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2009/03/23/functional-in-the-small-oo-in-the-large/), so it will not pretend that Swift is a purely functional language and use monads, arrows and comonads, but only small pieces of functional ideas. Also you should read [this paper](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2611829). That's why this library will selectively include some code from beautiful https://github.com/typelift frameworks with additions and without heavy constructs. Also this library tries to reimplement functions similar to ones found in Haskell Data/Prelude libraries in idiomatic Swift way. In addition there will be some general helpers for everyday tasks. Each function has detailed comments, which you can use as docs.
