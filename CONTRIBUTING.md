## Prefer Pull Requests

If you know exactly how to implement the feature being suggested or fix the bug
being reported, please open a pull request instead of an issue. Pull requests are easier than
patches or inline code blocks for discussing and merging the changes.

If you can't make the change yourself, please open an issue after making sure
that one isn't already logged
